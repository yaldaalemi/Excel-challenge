# Excel Challenge: Uncovering Crowdfunding Trends

## Background
This Excel Challenge delves into crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, aiming to discover hidden trends among 1,000 sample projects. By analyzing the data, we seek insights into factors contributing to project success or failure.

## Key Steps
- Data Preparation: Organized the data, created new columns like "Percent Funded" and "Average Donation."
- Category Analysis: Examined project outcomes by category, visualizing the results with pivot tables and charts.
- Subcategory Analysis: Delved deeper into subcategories, again using pivot tables and charts.
- Date Conversions: Converted Unix timestamps into date formats for better analysis.
- Launch Date vs. Outcome: Investigated how launch date impacts project outcomes.
- Report Creation: Answered critical questions about crowdfunding campaigns in a Microsoft Word report.
- Goal Analysis: Analyzed project outcomes based on funding goals, presenting the results in a table and chart.
- Statistical Analysis: Evaluated the number of backers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns.

## Conclusions
- The dataset reveals correlations between launch dates and campaign outcomes.
- Limitations include a lack of real-time data and potential bias in project selection.
- Additional tables and graphs could provide insights into geographical trends and success rates.

## Crowdfunding Goal Analysis
- Explored the relationship between funding goals and success rates.
- Created a table and line chart to visualize goal-related data.

## Statistical Analysis
- Calculated statistics for the number of backers in successful and unsuccessful campaigns.
- Determined which measure (mean or median) better summarizes the data.
- Assessed variability in both types of campaigns.
