# Excel Challenge: Uncovered Crowdfunding Trends

## Background
In this Excel Challenge, I delved into crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, aiming to discover hidden trends among 1,000 sample projects. By analyzing the data, I sought insights into factors that contributed to project success or failure.

## Key Steps
- Data Preparation: Organized the data, created new columns like "Percent Funded" and "Average Donation."
- Category Analysis: Examined project outcomes by category, visualized the results with pivot tables and charts.
- Subcategory Analysis: Delved deeper into subcategories, again using pivot tables and charts.
- Date Conversions: Converted Unix timestamps into date formats for better analysis.
- Launch Date vs. Outcome: Investigated how launch date impacted project outcomes.
- Report Creation: Answered critical questions about crowdfunding campaigns in a Microsoft Word report.
- Goal Analysis: Analyzed project outcomes based on funding goals, presented the results in a table and chart.
- Statistical Analysis: Evaluated the number of backers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns.

## Conclusions
- The dataset revealed correlations between launch dates and campaign outcomes.
- Limitations included a lack of real-time data and potential bias in project selection.
- Additional tables and graphs could provide insights into geographical trends and success rates.

## Crowdfunding Goal Analysis
- Explored the relationship between funding goals and success rates.
- Created a table and line chart to visualize goal-related data.

## Statistical Analysis
- Calculated statistics for the number of backers in successful and unsuccessful campaigns.
- Determined which measure (mean or median) better summarized the data.
- Assessed variability in both types of campaigns.
